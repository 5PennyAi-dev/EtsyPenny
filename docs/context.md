## 4. Latest Developments
- [Completed] Authentication System implemented (Login, SignUp, AuthContext).
- [Completed] Protected Routes logic and redirection (`/studio`, `/login`).
- [Completed] Database Schema: `public.profiles` table linked to `auth.users`.
- [Fix] Admin User: Manually repaired via SQL (Identity inserted, NULL tokens cleared).
- [Fix] **Auth Hang Resolved**: Implemented race-condition safety in `AuthContext` to prevent infinite loading spinners.
- [Fix] **Database Schema**: Added missing `status` and `title` columns to `listings` table.
- [Live] `ProductStudio` is now fully integrated with real user data (Credits/ID).
- [Live] **End-to-End Analysis Flow**: Successful image upload, database insertion, and N8N webhook trigger confirmed.
- [Live] **Real-time SEO Results**: `ProductStudio.jsx` now listens to database changes and displays live analysis results.
- [UI] **Main + Sidebar Layout**: Refactored `ResultsDisplay.jsx` into a 66/33 (8/4 col) grid. Main column for visual context & full data table; Sticky sidebar for "Magic Draft" listing generation.
- [Logic] **State Management**: Implemented `handleGenerateDraft` in `ProductStudio` to manage the transition from "Analysis Ready" to "Drafting" to "Editor" states. Added `analysisContext` to persist form data (Tone, Sub-niche).
- [Live] **N8N Drafting Integration**: "Magic Draft" workflow implemented. Consolidated Analysis and Drafting to one webhook endpoint to fix CORS. Standardized payload schema (nested `payload`) and handled array response format.
- [UI] **UX Refinements**: Auto-expanding description textarea using `useLayoutEffect`, compacted table design, and full tag visibility.
- [Feature] **History System**: Created `HistoryPage` with search/filter/pagination and `RecentOptimizations` component.
- [Feature] **PDF Export**: Implemented `ListingPDFDocument` with `@react-pdf/renderer` for generating branded SEO reports. Added export buttons to Studio and History.
- [Feature] **PDF Refinement**: Professional layout upgrade (Full-width, Stacked), status icons (Trending/Evergreen/Promising), and comprehensive legend.


- [Feature] **Brand Profile**: Implemented `/shop` (BrandProfilePage) to store shop identity (Name, Bio, Tone, Target Audience). Integrated with `ProductStudio` via N8N payload (`shop_context`) for personalized AI generation.
- [Feature] **Shop Analysis**: Added "Analyze My Shop" webhook to auto-fill brand profile from an Etsy shop URL.
- [Feature] **Relaunch Capabilities**: Added "Refresh Data" (re-analyze existing image) and "Regenerate Draft" buttons to `ResultsDisplay`.
- [Feature] **Form Persistence**: `OptimizationForm` now remembers settings (Theme, Niche, Tone) when loading a listing or after analysis, allowing for easy iteration.
- [UX] **Smart Inputs**: Auto-expanding text areas for Bio/Audience/Signature. Converted Brand Tone to text input for flexibility.
- [Fix] **Relaunch Logic**: Implemented `ConfirmationModal` for credit checks, fixed `handleAnalyze` image validation bugs, and resolved `onRelaunchSEO` prop issues.
- [Fix] **Image Persistence**: `ImageUpload` now correctly displays existing images when modifying settings or relaunching.
- [Feature] **Dashboard**: Implemented comprehensive dashboard with Credits management, Status tracking (New/SEO done/Complete), and detailed listings table. Uses optimized Supabase views.
- [Feature] **Visual Analysis** (2026-02-11): New 2-column grid layout in Product Studio — compact image upload (left 1/3) + 6 Visual Analysis fields (right 2/3): Aesthetic Style, Typography, Graphics, Color Palette, Target Audience, Overall Vibe. Fields auto-populated via `analyseImage` n8n webhook (AI vision), auto-resize to fit content.
- [Feature] **Visual Analysis → SEO Pipeline**: Visual fields saved to `listings` table (`visual_aesthetic`, `visual_typography`, `visual_graphics`, `visual_colors`, `visual_target_audience`, `visual_overall_vibe`) and included in `generate_seo` and `drafting_seo` payloads for richer AI context.
- [Fix] **Listing Reload from History**: Added `sub_niches(name)` join to Supabase query. Removed hardcoded `"Loaded from history"` / `"Unknown"` fallbacks — empty values now sent as `null`. Visual Analysis fields hydrated on reload.
- [Fix] **Payload Cleanup**: `niche`, `sub_niche` in categorization payloads now default to `null` instead of `"General"` or `"Unknown"`.
- [UX] **Default Product Type**: `OptimizationForm` now defaults to T-Shirt instead of first alphabetical product type.
- [UI] **ImageUpload Compact Mode**: `ImageUpload.jsx` supports a `compact` prop for smaller rendering in the 1/3 column.

## 5. Next Steps (Action Items)
- Polish the Login/Signup UI.
- Implement the comprehensive Landing Page.
- Build the Stripe Payment Integration (Credits & Subscriptions).
- Test end-to-end Visual Analysis flow (analyze → save → reload → re-analyze).
